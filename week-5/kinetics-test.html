<h4>I wanted to make up a site that I thought I/other people could use for fiction writing involving supernatural abilities. It's going to need a lot a work but I thought it would be a pretty cool thing to work on. Though the sources I've gotten some of this info from seem to take it all a bit too seriously...Fornow it's in table form, but I may expand it to a more multipage system with more information.</h4>
