<h3>Tell me more about comets!</h3>

<section id="maincontent">

<p>Astronomers state that comets formed around 4.6 billion years ago when the solar system was born. They contain a mix of
frozen gases, rocks, ice and dust. Comets are sometimes called icy dirtballs. Because of their low mass, comets cannot
become round under their own gravity and will have irregular shapes. Comet nuclei are one of the darkest substances
in the Universe they only reflect 4% of light. For a reference, asphalt reflects 7% of light. They orbit that sun
in an elliptical pattern. There are short period comets, broken into the Jupiter family (less than 20 years) and the
Halley family (less than 200 years). There are also long- period orbits which are any comet that has an orbit lasting
longer than 200 years.</p>

<div> Fun Facts as told by NASA: </div>
<ul>
<li>Gravity on the moon is only 1/6 of that found on Earth.</li>
<li>Unlike past missions, LADEE will be using lasers instead of radio waves to communicate with mission control.</li>
<li>Seeing the Earth rise from the moon never gets old.</li>
<li>LADEE will be launched on an five-stage Minotaur V rocket. The first three stages of the Minotaur V are former Peacekeeper ballistic solid rocket motors. The fourth and fifth stages are commercial motors.</li>
<li>The first human being walked on the moon on 20 July 1969.</li>
<li>Moon-rock ages range from about 3.2 billion years in the maria (dark, low basins) to nearly 4.6 billion years in the terrae (light, rugged highlands). Active geologic forces, including plate tectonics and erosion, continuously repave the oldest surfaces on Earth whereas old surfaces persist with little disturbance on the moon.</li> 
<li>The light, rugged highlands of the moon are called the "terrae."</li>
<li>Only 12 people have ever walked on the surface of the moon.</li>
<li>The largest impact basin in the Earth-moon system is the South-Pole-Aitken basin on the moon measuring 2,500 km in diameter?</li>
<li>Most ancient religions had a moon god or goddess. One Roman moon goddess was named Luna, and this is why many modern words associated with the moon have "Luna" as their root.</li>

<td> Phases of the Moon are caused by a shadow from the Earth, clouds, or the Earth's or Moon's rotation.</td>
<td>Our perspective of the Moon's sunlit appearance changes as it orbits Earth.</td>

<td> Different countries see different phases of the Moon on the same day.</td>
<td> Everyone sees the same phases of the Moon, but people south of the equator who face North to see the Moon when it is high in the sky will see the Moon upside down so that the reverse side is lit.</td>

<td>The Moon goes around the Earth in a single day.</td>
<td> It takes about a month for the Moon to orbit Earth (27.3 days to complete a revolution, but 29.5 days to change from New Moon to New Moon)</td>

<tr>
<td>4</td>
<td> The Moon makes its own light (the same way the Sun does).</td>
<td> The Moon reflects the light of the Sun, just as the planets do. In fact, the bright part of the Moon is experiencing daytime.</td>	
</tr>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>5</td>
<td>The Moon does not rotate.</td>
<td> The Moon does spin on its axis, completing a rotation once every 27.3 days; the confusion is caused because it also takes the same period to orbit the Earth, so that it keeps the same side facing us</td>	
</tr>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>6</td>
<td>The same half of the Moon is in darkness all the time-i.e. that there is a dark side of the Moon.</td>
<td>The Moon has no side that is constantly dark; the front and back are alternately lit as the Moon rotates. Far side is a more accurate term.</td>	
</tr>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>7</td>
<td>The Moon has no gravity; things float "up" when dropped on the Moon.</td>
<td>The Moon does have gravity, but because it has less mass than the Earth, it has 1/6 of Earth's gravity at its surface. </td>	
</tr>
</tr>
<td>8</td>
<td>The Moon is only visible at night.</td>
<td> We frequently see the Moon in the day; the only phases of the Moon that cannot be seen in the day are full moon (which is usually only visible at night) and the new moon (which is not visible from Earth at all).</td>	
</tr>
</tr>
<td>9</td>
<td> The Moon becomes larger on the horizon because it is closer to Earth.</td>
<td>This is an optical illusion. For reasons not fully understood by astronomers or psychologists, low-hanging moons look unnaturally large when they beam through trees, building or other foreground objects.</td>
