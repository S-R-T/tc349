The Final site is a portfolio for one of my other classes, mixing the two requirements together.
Some of the stuff I wanted to do required a lot of looking around and mixing code till it worked
It passed validation(the css i had to run through a different validator) but there might be some leftover code

Wasn't 100% sure what to put up for the preproduction work as I usually work things out as I go along.

I'm sure there some things I've forgot to mention so please be patiant with me if I'm missing some info.
