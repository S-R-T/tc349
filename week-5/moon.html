<h3>Tell me more about comets!</h3>

<section id="maincontent">

<p>The regular daily and monthly rhythms of Earth's only natural satellite, the Moon, have guided timekeepers for thousands of years. Its influence on Earth's cycles, notably tides, has been charted by many cultures in many ages.<br><br>
The presence of the Moon moderates Earth's wobble on its axis, leading to a relatively stable climate over billions of years. From Earth, we always see the same face of the Moon because the Moon rotates once on its own axis in the same time that it travels once around Earth (called synchronous rotation).<br><br>
The light areas of the Moon are known as the highlands. The dark features, called maria (Latin for seas), are impact basins that were filled with lava between 4 and 2.5 billion years ago.<br><br>
Though the Moon has no internally generated magnetic field, areas of magnetism are preserved in the lunar crust, but how this occurred is a mystery. The early Moon appears not to have had the right conditions to develop an internal dynamo, the mechanism for global magnetic fields for the terrestrial planets.<br><br>
How did the Moon come to be? The leading theory is that a Mars-sized body collided with Earth approximately 4.5 billion years ago, and the resulting debris from both Earth and the impactor accumulated to form our natural satellite. The newly formed Moon was in a molten state. Within about 100 million years, most of the global "magma ocean" had crystallized, with less dense rocks floating upward and eventually forming the lunar crust.<br><br>
With essentially no atmosphere to impede impacts, a steady rain of asteroids, meteoroids and comets strike the surface. Over billions of years, the surface has been ground up into fragments ranging from huge boulders to powder. Nearly the entire Moon is covered by a rubble pile of charcoal-gray, powdery dust and rocky debris called the lunar regolith. Beneath the regolith is a region of fractured bedrock referred to as the megaregolith.<br><br>
Four impact structures are used to date objects on the Moon: the Nectaris and Imbrium basins and the craters Eratosthenes and Copernicus. Lunar history is based on time segments bounded by the age of each impact structure. A Copernican feature, for example, is as young or younger than the impact crater Copernicus, that is, about one billion years old or less.<br><br>
The Moon was first visited by the USSR's Luna 1 and Luna 2 in 1959. These were followed by a number of U.S. and Soviet robotic spacecraft. The U.S. sent three classes of robotic missions to prepare the way for human exploration: the Rangers (1961-1965) were impact probes, the Lunar Orbiters (1966-1967) mapped the surface to find landing sites and the Surveyors (1966-1968) were soft landers.<br><br>
The first human landing on the Moon was on 20 July 1969. During the Apollo missions of 1969-1972, 12 American astronauts walked on the Moon and used a Lunar Roving Vehicle to travel on the surface and extend their studies of soil mechanics, meteoroids, lunar ranging, magnetic fields and solar wind. The Apollo astronauts brought back 382 kg (842 pounds) of rock and soil to Earth for study.<br><br>
After a long hiatus, lunar exploration resumed in the 1990s with the U.S. robotic missions Clementine and Lunar Propspector. Results from both missions suggest that water ice may be present at the lunar poles, but a controlled impact of the Prospector spacecraft produced no observable water.<br><br>
A new era of international lunar exploration began in earnest in the new millennium. The European Space Agency was first with SMART-1 in 2003, followed by three spacecraft from other nations during the years 2007 and 2008: Kaguya (Japan), Chang'e-1 (China), and Chandrayaan-1 (India). The U.S. began a new series of robotic lunar missions with the joint launch of the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter and LCROSS in 2009. More missions are planned in anticipation of sending human beings back to the Moon.

<div> Fun Facts as told by NASA: </div>
<ul>
<li>Gravity on the moon is only 1/6 of that found on Earth.</li>
<li>Unlike past missions, LADEE will be using lasers instead of radio waves to communicate with mission control.</li>
<li>Seeing the Earth rise from the moon never gets old.</li>
<li>LADEE will be launched on an five-stage Minotaur V rocket. The first three stages of the Minotaur V are former Peacekeeper ballistic solid rocket motors. The fourth and fifth stages are commercial motors.</li>
<li>The first human being walked on the moon on 20 July 1969.</li>
<li>Moon-rock ages range from about 3.2 billion years in the maria (dark, low basins) to nearly 4.6 billion years in the terrae (light, rugged highlands). Active geologic forces, including plate tectonics and erosion, continuously repave the oldest surfaces on Earth whereas old surfaces persist with little disturbance on the moon.</li> 
<li>The light, rugged highlands of the moon are called the "terrae."</li>
<li>Only 12 people have ever walked on the surface of the moon.</li>
<li>The largest impact basin in the Earth-moon system is the South-Pole-Aitken basin on the moon measuring 2,500 km in diameter?</li>
<li>Most ancient religions had a moon god or goddess. One Roman moon goddess was named Luna, and this is why many modern words associated with the moon have "Luna" as their root.</li>

<td>The Moon does not rotate.</td>
<td> The Moon does spin on its axis, completing a rotation once every 27.3 days; the confusion is caused because it also takes the same period to orbit the Earth, so that it keeps the same side facing us</td>

<td>The same half of the Moon is in darkness all the time-i.e. that there is a dark side of the Moon.</td>
<td>The Moon has no side that is constantly dark; the front and back are alternately lit as the Moon rotates. Far side is a more accurate term.</td>

<tr>
<td>7</td>
<td>The Moon has no gravity; things float "up" when dropped on the Moon.</td>
<td>The Moon does have gravity, but because it has less mass than the Earth, it has 1/6 of Earth's gravity at its surface. </td>

<td>8</td>
<td>The Moon is only visible at night.</td>
<td> We frequently see the Moon in the day; the only phases of the Moon that cannot be seen in the day are full moon (which is usually only visible at night) and the new moon (which is not visible from Earth at all).</td>	
</tr>

<td>9</td>
<td> The Moon becomes larger on the horizon because it is closer to Earth.</td>
<td>This is an optical illusion. For reasons not fully understood by astronomers or psychologists, low-hanging moons look unnaturally large when they beam through trees, building or other foreground objects.</td>
