<h3>Tell me more about comets!</h3>

<section id="maincontent">

<p>Astronomers state that comets formed around 4.6 billion years ago when the solar system was born. They contain a mix of
frozen gases, rocks, ice and dust. Comets are sometimes called icy dirtballs. Because of their low mass, comets cannot
become round under their own gravity and will have irregular shapes. Comet nuclei are one of the darkest substances
in the Universe they only reflect 4% of light. For a reference, asphalt reflects 7% of light. They orbit that sun
in an elliptical pattern. There are short period comets, broken into the Jupiter family (less than 20 years) and the
Halley family (less than 200 years). There are also long- period orbits which are any comet that has an orbit lasting
longer than 200 years.</p>

<li>The force of gravity can rip comets apart</li>
<li>Comet nuclei can range from 100 meters to more than 40 kilometers</li>
<li>Some long period comets have orbits that can last millions of years</li>
<li>In ancient times, comets were known to be as sign of bad luck. In fact,
a Roman Emperor once ordered all of his successors to be executed because he saw a comet</li>
